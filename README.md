# virtual-hack-MNR-MTA
This project aims at the development of a consumer mobile application that allows Metro-North ridership to check availability, spacing and social distancing on each of MNR trains. This has been achieved using a blend of Microsoftâ€™s Cloud services, MTA provided and public datasets.
